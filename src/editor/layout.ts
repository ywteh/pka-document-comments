/**
 * Mirrors the layout/visibility state onto the `.cm-editor` element as plain
 * classes (`dc-has`, `dc-highlights`, `dc-hide-resolved`) so the stylesheet can
 * cap the text column and toggle highlights with ordinary descendant selectors —
 * no `:has()`. We route through CodeMirror's `editorAttributes` facet rather than
 * `classList` on `view.dom`, because CodeMirror owns that element's className and
 * rewrites it on reconfigure; a raw `classList.add` gets silently dropped (the
 * reason the layout used to key off a `:has()` of our own child element instead).
 *
 * The value recomputes on every transaction — including the empty `dispatch({})`
 * the plugin fires when a setting toggles — so the classes always track state.
